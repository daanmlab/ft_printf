# ‚úÖ ft_printf with a 100% mark

## Hey Everyone! üëãüèΩ
Welcome to `ft_printf`! This is where we take a deep dive into one of the most used C functions: `printf`. But here's the twist ‚Äì we're going to build our own version from the ground up. Ready for this fun challenge?

## The Mission
`ft_printf` is all about understanding how `printf` works by recreating it. We'll explore formatting, handling different data types, and getting those outputs just right. It's a great way to boost your C skills and get a real grip on data formatting.

## Getting Ready
You should be comfy with C programming ‚Äì loops, variables, and functions should be your friends. Familiarity with the original `printf` function will be a big plus!

## Setting Things Up
To get started with our custom `printf`, do the following:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/daanmlab/ft_printf.git
```
Then, compile it:
```bash
make
```
And there you go, your very own `ft_printf` is ready to roll!

## Features
Our `ft_printf` can handle various formats like:
- `%s` for strings
- `%d` for integers
- ...and more (check the repo for all the cool stuff!)

## Usage Example
Here's a quick look at how to use it:
```c
#include "ft_printf.h"

int main() {
    ft_printf("Hello, 42! %d\n", 42);
    return 0;
}
```
